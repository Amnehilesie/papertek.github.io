        <h1>Camellia Server Staff Guidelines</h1>
        <p id="footNote">
          These guidelines were last updated on 11/2/23. This page is a work in
          progress.
        </p>
        <div class="card">
          <h2>A Brief History</h2>
          <p class="italic">
            The Staff Guidelines were implemented for a general view of
            guidance, advice, and staff quality. Parts One and Two of these
            guidelines were written and established on October 24, 2022. Since
            then, users have had concerns regarding our decisions and stances in
            particular situations. As a result, the Staff Guidelines were made
            public on July 25, 2023, as evidenced by this document you're
            reading. All staff decisions are based on these guidelines. While we
            attempt to have high moderation standards, we sometimes make
            mistakes.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
            Following these guidelines helps avoid mistakes in the future. If
            not, the guidelines are updated to resolve mistakes we have made in
            the past.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
            Any significant instance of drama, discussion, and feedback is
            considered when writing these guidelines. If you would like to be a
            part of the staff team, you must follow these guidelines to a
            degree. If you would like to contribute, that's great! Leave your
            feedback in

            A reminder that anything said in the staff chats is to be kept in
            the staff chats unless stated otherwise by an Admin. Failure to do
            so will lead to demotion.
          </p>
          <h2>Part 1: The Dos</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Punish people accordingly if they break the rules. The template
              for punishing someone is VERBAL WARNING -> INFRACTION -> TEMPMUTE
              -> KICK -> BAN. The template may vary based on how severely
              someone is acting. Use good judgment when punishing someone. If
              staff members cannot decide on a consensus for a member, a verbal
              warning should be given by default.
            </li>
            <div class="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              Try to be nice. This place is supposed to welcome everyone
              regardless of who they are.
            </li>
            <div class="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              Try not to be an arbitrary person or make arbitrary decisions in a
              situation; doing this is not ideal.
            </li>
            <div class="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              Try not to be arrogant and avoid brown-nosing. Doing this makes
              you look stupid and does not fall within the ideals of the staff
              team. Remind yourself that we are all one!
            </li>
            <div class="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              Treat others how you want to be treated, and try to be
              approachable to other members.
            </li>
            <div class="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              Before making server changes or creating events, please mention it
              to other staff members so it can be noticed!
            </li>
            <div class="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              Contact another staff member if you're feeling burnt out and/or
              you need help with moderating. The staff team looks for consistent
              contribution, not overloaded. Make sure to contact another staff
              member if you need to.
            </li>
            <div class="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              Try to mention your actions and anything relevant regarding a
              particular member and/or punishments. This is for transparency's
              sake.
            </li>
            <div class="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              Listen to the room in certain situations; forcefully changing a
              sensitive topic in a channel will only leave people confused and
              the situation unresolved. Your job is to please all parties. Only
              in extreme cases should sensitive topics be forcefully shifted.
            </li>
            <div class="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              Political/religious talk is not allowed on the main channels. This
              server has many people with differing opinions. If anyone is
              talking about political situations, redirect them to
              #serious-talk. If anyone is hateful toward a specified group,
              please use the FAQ commands on bigotry (?bigot) or punish them
              accordingly.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <div class="vertLine"></div>
          <h2>Part 2: Expectations</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              You are expected not to take server rules and guidelines lightly.
              Always remember to refer to these guidelines and look in the
              server rules if you need a refresher. Remember, you have a
              significant influence on members and outsiders.
            </li>
            <div class="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              You are expected to know basic moderation commands (For Discord).
              For using John Wick, basic commands are !warn !timeout add !purge
              and !kick.
            </li>
            <div class="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              You are expected to know basic FAQ commands pinned in
              #mod-commands. Please read them!
            </li>
            <div class="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              You are expected to help people when implied or asked (but don't
              create too much noise!).
            </li>
            <div class="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              You are expected to use your best judgment when it comes to
              punishing someone or warning them.
            </li>
            <div class="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              You are expected to be civil in and outside the community's
              central server. (This includes neighboring servers, other
              platforms associated with Camellia, etc.) Do not play middle,
              either! This ruins staff credibility.
            </li>
            <div class="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              You are expected to look at the suggestion channels and
              suggestions in general. If a member suggests something for the
              server, please repost it in the suggestion channels or bring it up
              in the staff chat to be noticed.
            </li>
            <div class="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              You are expected to help lead the server in the best direction for
              you and its members.
            </li>
            <div class="vertLine"></div>
            <li>You are expected to be present when needed.</li>
            <div class="vertLine"></div>
            <li>You are expected to be cool. (Be cool!)</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Part 3: General Advice</h2>
          <p class="italic">
            I have noticed staff members complain and some people being afraid
            of becoming staff members due to how large this server is. Never
            fear; this part of the guidelines will guide you on certain things!

            In extreme circumstances, we may ban individuals for their actions

            remember to use good judgment on what to do!
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Contact other staff members about the situation and provide a chat

              feel comfortable with what's happening. By doing this method, it
              should be easier to diverge a heated topic/discussion and talk
              about something else.

              If someone complains about their punishment not being listed in

              Alternatively, ignore them (I really like doing this one

          <p class="italic">
            This is to ensure clarity between staff members during staff
            discussions.

          <h3 class="centerItem">Common Terminology</h3>
          <div class="vertLine"></div>
          <p class="italic">
            Using Wick, the moderation bot, there are a couple of commands.
            These commands are: /warn /kick /ban, and /infractions. We want to
            generalize terms we use when referring to moderation in general, so
            keep these in mind.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              [Warn/Infraction]: A server warning issued by the bot to keep
              track of how many infractions somebody has. The bot will punish a
              member automatically based on several infractions.
            </li>
            <div class="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              [Verbal]: This refers to a verbal warning; verbal warnings could
              also be called "soft warnings" and are issued before severe action
              is taken. FAQ Commands are included.
            </li>
            <div class="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              [Restriction/Restricted]: A restricted user cannot use a specific
              chat category or channel. These are issued when users can't stay
              on topic or provide unwanted discussion/noise.
            </li>
            <div class="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              [Timeout/Mute]: Users that cannot speak in chats for a specified
              time.
            </li>
            <div class="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              [Noise]: Could be used for people talking too much. Example: "Stop
              creating noise, please." This could also be used instead of
              saying, "Shut the fuck up."
            </li>

          <h3 class="centerItem">Wick's AutoMod</h3>
          <div class="vertLine"></div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Each infraction given by John Wick is a total of 5 warning points.
            </li>
            <div class="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              15 warning points give 1-hour timeouts. 25 warning points give
              1-day timeouts, and 35 warning points kick members.
            </li>
            <div class="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              AutoMod also has a heating system. Each rule is defined with a
              certain percentage of heat before it warns a member. For example,
              if a user is spamming similar messages, heat is added by 22%. A
              member needs to send approximately 4.50 messages before getting
              punished, and so on.
