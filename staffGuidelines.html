              <p class="italic">
                The Staff Guidelines were implemented for a general view of
                guidance, advice, and staff quality. Parts One and Two of these
                guidelines were written and established on October 24, 2022.
                Since then, users have had concerns regarding our decisions and
                stances in particular situations. As a result, the Staff
                Guidelines were made public on July 25, 2023, as evidenced by
                this document you're reading. All staff decisions are based on
                these guidelines. While we attempt to have high moderation
                standards, we sometimes make mistakes.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
                Following these guidelines helps avoid mistakes in the future.
                If not, the guidelines are updated to resolve mistakes we have
                made in the past.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
                Any significant instance of drama, discussion, and feedback is
                considered when writing these guidelines. If you would like to
                be a part of the staff team, you must follow these guidelines to
                a degree. If you would like to contribute, that's great! Leave

                A reminder that anything said in the staff chats is to be kept
                in the staff chats unless stated otherwise by an Admin. Failure
                to do so will lead to demotion.

                  Punish people accordingly if they break the rules. The
                  template for punishing someone is VERBAL WARNING -> INFRACTION
                  -> TEMPMUTE -> KICK -> 8-DAY BAN -> INDEF BAN. The template
                  may vary based on how severely someone is acting. Use good
                  judgment when punishing someone. If staff members cannot
                  decide on a consensus for a member, a verbal warning should be
                  given by default.

                  Contact another staff member if you're feeling burnt out
                  and/or you need help with moderating. The staff team looks for
                  consistent contribution, not overloaded. Make sure to contact
                  another staff member if you need to.

                  is talking about political situations, redirect them to
                  #serious-talk. If anyone is hateful toward a specified group,

                Using Wick, the moderation bot, there are a couple of commands.
                These commands are: /warn /kick /ban, and /infractions. We want
                to generalize terms we use when referring to moderation in
                general, so keep these in mind.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  [Warn/Infraction]: A server warning issued by the bot to keep
                  track of how many infractions somebody has. The bot will
                  punish a member automatically based on several infractions.
                </li>
                <div class="vertLine"></div>
                <li>
                  [Verbal]: This refers to a verbal warning; verbal warnings
                  could also be called "soft warnings" and are issued before
                  severe action is taken. FAQ Commands are included.
                </li>
                <div class="vertLine"></div>
                <li>
                  [Restriction/Restricted]: A restricted user cannot use a
                  specific chat category or channel. These are issued when users
                  can't stay on topic or provide unwanted discussion/noise.

                  [Noise]: Could be used for people talking too much. Example:
                  "Stop creating noise, please." This could also be used instead
                  of saying, "Shut the fuck up."

                <li>
                  Each infraction given by John Wick is a total of 5 warning
                  points.
                </li>
                <div class="vertLine"></div>
                <li>
                  15 warning points give 1-hour timeouts. 25 warning points give
                  1-day timeouts, and 35 warning points kick members.
                </li>
                <div class="vertLine"></div>
                <li>
                  AutoMod also has a heating system. Each rule is defined with a
                  certain percentage of heat before it warns a member. For
                  example, if a user is spamming similar messages, heat is added
                  by 22%. A member needs to send approximately 4.50 messages
                  before getting punished, and so on.

                  be denied in the application process but are given a chance to
                  prove themselves to the Admins. Trial Staff is also used as a
