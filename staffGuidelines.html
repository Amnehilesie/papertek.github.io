        <p id="footNote">These guidelines were last updated on 11/2/23.</p>
        <div class="card">
          <h2>A Brief History</h2>
          <p>
            The Staff Guidelines were implemented for a general view of
            guidance, advice, and staff quality. Parts One and Two of these
            guidelines were written and established on October 24, 2022. Since
            then, users have had concerns regarding our decisions and stances in
            particular situations. As a result, the Staff Guidelines were made
            public on July 25, 2023, as evidenced by this document you're
            reading. All staff decisions are based on these guidelines. While we
            attempt to have high moderation standards, we sometimes make
            mistakes. Following these guidelines helps avoid mistakes in the
            future. If not, the guidelines are updated to resolve mistakes we
            have made in the past. Any significant instance of drama,
            discussion, and feedback is considered when writing these
            guidelines. If you would like to be a part of the staff team, you
            must follow these guidelines to a degree. If you would like to
            contribute, that's great! Leave your feedback in #ðŸ’¡server-direction
            where it will be considered. If you would like to apply for Helper,
            refer here. Have fun reading~

            A reminder that anything said in the staff chats is to be kept in
            the staff chats unless stated otherwise by an Admin. Failure to do
            so will lead to demotion.

          <h2>Part 1: The Dos</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Punish people accordingly if they break the rules. The template
              for punishing someone is VERBAL WARNING -> INFRACTION -> TEMPMUTE
              -> KICK -> BAN. The template may vary based on how severely
              someone is acting. Use good judgment when punishing someone. If
              staff members cannot decide on a consensus for a member, a verbal
              warning should be given by default.
            </li>
            <div id="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              Try to be nice. This place is supposed to welcome everyone
              regardless of who they are.
            </li>
            <div id="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              Try not to be an arbitrary person or make arbitrary decisions in a
              situation; doing this is not ideal.
            </li>
            <div id="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              Try not to be arrogant and avoid brown-nosing. Doing this makes
              you look stupid and does not fall within the ideals of the staff
              team. Remind yourself that we are all one!
            </li>
            <div id="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              Treat others how you want to be treated, and try to be
              approachable to other members.
            </li>
            <div id="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              Before making server changes or creating events, please mention it
              to other staff members so it can be noticed!
            </li>
            <div id="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              Contact another staff member if you're feeling burnt out and/or
              you need help with moderating. The staff team looks for consistent
              contribution, not overloaded. Make sure to contact another staff
              member if you need to.
            </li>
            <div id="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              Try to mention your actions and anything relevant regarding a
              particular member and/or punishments. This is for transparency's
              sake.
            </li>
            <div id="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              Listen to the room in certain situations; forcefully changing a
              sensitive topic in a channel will only leave people confused and
              the situation unresolved. Your job is to please all parties. Only
              in extreme cases should sensitive topics be forcefully shifted.
            </li>
            <div id="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              Political/religious talk is not allowed on the main channels. This
              server has many people with differing opinions. If anyone is
              talking about political situations, redirect them to
              #serious-talk. If anyone is hateful toward a specified group,
              please use the FAQ commands on bigotry (?bigot) or punish them
              accordingly.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <div id="vertLine"></div>
          <h2>Part 2: Expectations</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              You are expected not to take server rules and guidelines lightly.
              Always remember to refer to these guidelines and look in the
              server rules if you need a refresher. Remember, you have a
              significant influence on members and outsiders.
            </li>
            <div id="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              You are expected to know basic moderation commands (For Discord).
              For using John Wick, basic commands are !warn !timeout add !purge
              and !kick.
            </li>
            <div id="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              You are expected to know basic FAQ commands pinned in
              #mod-commands. Please read them!
            </li>
            <div id="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              You are expected to help people when implied or asked (but don't
              create too much noise!).
            </li>
            <div id="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              You are expected to use your best judgment when it comes to
              punishing someone or warning them.
            </li>
            <div id="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              You are expected to be civil in and outside the community's
              central server. (This includes neighboring servers, other
              platforms associated with Camellia, etc.) Do not play middle,
              either! This ruins staff credibility.
            </li>
            <div id="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              You are expected to look at the suggestion channels and
              suggestions in general. If a member suggests something for the
              server, please repost it in the suggestion channels or bring it up
              in the staff chat to be noticed.
            </li>
            <div id="vertLine"></div>
            <li>
              You are expected to help lead the server in the best direction for
              you and its members.
            </li>
            <div id="vertLine"></div>
            <li>You are expected to be present when needed.</li>
            <div id="vertLine"></div>
            <li>You are expected to be cool. (Be cool!)</li>
          </ol>
